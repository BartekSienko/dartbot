## The project ended up being largely refactored into Flutter/Dart for it's frontend capabilities. A new repo was opened for it at https://github.com/BartekSienko/dartbot-redux/





# dartbot
A dart app with a AI bot included as the opponent, also with a career mode game planned down the road


## Current work progress:
- A match engine with manual playing has been implemented
- Some customization in match types has also been added (301, setplay, double in/out)
- A more complicated version of the dartbot exists but still needs work with (Bot can play with a 3-dart average of 30ish-130)

## To be added:
- Further Adjustable difficulty for dartbot (reaching down to 20 average)
- Being able to create custom tournaments
- Saving progress for tournaments and career modes
- More customizable match types (2v2)
- Career mode around engine
